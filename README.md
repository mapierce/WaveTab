## 🤔 About 

WaveTab is a `UITabBarController` that acts like a wave when moving between tabs. It works everywhere you'd expect it to, rotates, and scales according to device. It was inspired by a [plat4m](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtyXrgLjVkD/?igshid=8fsg1k1l0tt9) design. Please see below for a small screen recording of it in action.
